<h1>Banking Project V3</h1>
</div>

This is a class project I made using C++ and SQL programming languages in Spring 2024. Visual Studio 2022 and MySQL were used to build the program and the databases that contain the information that is used during runtime. This project simulates a Banking Application where customers can manage their money and add other members as contacts in order to request & send funds. The manager role can see who is enrolled, pull information, and delete invalid users.

The program launches in a console window, which is best displayed in fullscreen for the most efficient experience. 
The project is presented using UI elements provided by the <ins>***javax.swing***</ins> library. The user is presented with a welcome message and is asked to answer "**yes**" or "**no**". If the user enters an input other than the ones listed, the dialog box will continue popping up until the user enters a valid input. Entering yes will allow the user to place an order, entering no will terminate the program.
